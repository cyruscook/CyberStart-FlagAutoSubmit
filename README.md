# CyberStart-FlagAutoSubmit
This extension will automatically submit the flag when you complete a CyberStart challenge. This can be useful if you can't be bothered, or to lower the time it took you to complete the challenge (Yes this is recorded)

This will only work on challenges where you get the green popup saying "Success! The flag is: ...". Challenges such as solving a cipher or finding a file through ssh often won't meet this criteria.
